# CS2210
Data Structures and Algorithms

# Description and Topics

Solid foundations in the basic concepts of programming: data structures and algorithms. The main objective 
is to learn how to select and design data structures and algorithms that are appropriate for problems
that may be encountered. Show the correctness of algorithms and studying their computational complexities. 
There will be a mixture of theoretical knowledge and practical experience.
The study of data structures and algorithms is carried out within an object-oriented framework.
When implementations are considered, the Java programming language is used. Topics covered in
this course include:

• analysis of algorithms
• dictionaries, hash tables
• trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, multi-way search trees, (2,4)-trees, B-trees
• graphs, graph traversals, graph algorithms
• sorting
